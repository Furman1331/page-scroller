# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you'd like to fix a bug or propose a new feature, feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Guidelines:
- Commit your changes to the dev branch.
- Do not modify files in the dist/ directory.
- If your PR addresses an issue, mention the issue number in the comments (e.g., #16).
- Prioritize clarity over brevity in variable names, conditions, and functions.
- Provide a clear description of the problem in your Pull Request (yes, itâ€™s obviousâ€”but still worth mentioning!).
Thank you for your contributions! ðŸš€
